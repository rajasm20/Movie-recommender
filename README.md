A vector is a single dimesingle-dimensional signal NumPy array. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity, often used to measure document similarity in text analysis. We use the below formula to compute the cosine similarity.

Similarity = (A.B) / (||A||.||B||) 
where A and B are vectors:

A.B is dot product of A and B: It is computed as sum of element-wise product of A and B.
||A|| is L2 norm of A: It is computed as square root of the sum of squares of elements of the vector A.
